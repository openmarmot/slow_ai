# slow_ai change log 

----------------------------------
March 12 2024 
- initial project setup
- working on abstracting a general llama_cpp object 

funny thing about object inheritance here is that it doesn't really 
matter with python if i'm overwriting everthing - but i think 
its still nice to document the standard functions for the ai object
